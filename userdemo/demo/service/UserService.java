/**
 * Defines the service and its implementation
 * 
 * The service class is used to mark a class as a service provider. They are used to define business logic away from the controller.
 *  In this case, we don't perform any special operation in Service class so it could be avoided but itâ€™s always a nice practice
 *  to have them implemented.
