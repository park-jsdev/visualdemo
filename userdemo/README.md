# UserDemo
This is an early prototype for the user directory / social media feature for the project. \
The database was built with MySQL, the table can be seen below. \
The frontend was built with React, while the backend was developed with Java Spring Boot, set up with Web (MVC, Tomcat container), \
MySql Driver (JDBC), Spring Boot DevTools and Spring Data JPA. \
The application was packaged with Maven. \
The CRUD API was tested through Postman. \
The application was deployed onto both an AWS EC2 and Google Cloud Platform VM Instance remote server. \
SFTP was used to transfer the .jar file. \

## MySQL
```
CREATE TABLE `tb_user` (`id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, `name`
varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL, `gender` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
`company` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL, `dob` date DEFAULT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`));

insert into `tb_user` (`id`, `name`, `gender`, `company`, `dob`)
values('1', 'Sundar Pichai', 'Male', 'Google', '1972-06-10');

insert into `tb_user` (`id`, `name`, `gender`, `company`, `dob`)
values('2', 'Mark Zuckerberg', 'Male', 'Facebook', '1984-05-14');

```

## TODO
- Automate with Jenkins
- Use NGNIX server on Docker
