# Project Plan

## Project Purpose
To demonstrate:
- programming fluency
- knowledge of data structures and algorithms
- knowledge of software engineering, software architecture, system design, database design
- knowledge of infrastructure, cloud services, containers, deployment
- knowledge of full stack web application development using client-server architecture and REST 
- knowledge of modern technologies - APIs, frameworks, software services
- knowledge of QA / DevOps
- a full SDLC or agile cycle and deploy a project

## Project Scope

## Project Requirements
- Project must have a landing page, which uses a modern frontend framework (React)
- Project must have a main application, which visualizes algorithms, programming paradigms, patterns, system design concepts
- Project must be deployed onto a cloud platform (AWS / Google Cloud / Azure)
- Project must have planning documentation, data modelling, SRS
- Project must have a test suite and demonstrate testing (test-driven development, unit-tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests)
- Project must use a database, designed from schema and implemented with SQL

- Project should demonstrate features such as Load Balancing, Data Partitioning, LRU/LFU Cache, Social Media Tools, Feed Creation, Push notifications, TinyURL Encoding, Telemetry
- Project should demonstrate project management using modern technologies: Asana and Trello
