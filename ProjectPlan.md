# Project Plan

## Project Purpose
To demonstrate:
- programming fluency
- knowledge of data structures and algorithms
- knowledge of software engineering, software architecture, system design, database design
- knowledge of infrastructure, cloud services, containers, deployment
- knowledge of full stack web application development using client-server architecture and REST 
- knowledge of modern technologies - APIs, frameworks, software services
- knowledge of QA / DevOps
- a full SDLC or agile cycle and deploy a project

## Project Scope

## Project Requirements
- Project must have a landing page, which uses a modern frontend framework (React)
- Project must have a main application, which visualizes algorithms, programming paradigms, patterns, system design concepts
- Project must be deployed onto a cloud platform (AWS / Google Cloud / Azure)
- Project must have planning documentation, data modelling, SRS
- Project must have a test suite and demonstrate testing (test-driven development, unit-tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests)
- Project must use a database, designed from schema and implemented with SQL

- Project should demonstrate features such as Load Balancing, Data Partitioning, LRU/LFU Cache, Social Media Tools, Feed Creation, Push notifications, TinyURL Encoding, Telemetry
- Project should demonstrate project management using modern technologies: Asana and Trello
- Project should use Java backend, Spring Boot
- Project should demonstrate QA using modern technologies: JUnit, Selenium, Postman, JIRA
- Project should demonstrate DevOps using modern technologies: Jenkins, Ansible
- Project should demonstrate Database development using modern technologies and techniques: MySQL/Oracle, Vitess - Data Sharding, Load Balancing, Redis - Caching, Data Partitioning
- Project should demonstrate full stack development related technologies: Pusher, NGINX/Apache, ElasticSearch - Indexing, Electron - Web views
- Project should demonstrate container development: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
- Project should demonstrate api implementation and management using modern technologies: Apigee
- Project should experiment with microservices

## TODO
- Setup Project Plan
- High Level Design
- System Design Overview
- Implement Learning from Database, Software Engineering and Software Architecture & Design Courses
- Create the frontend prototype landing page
- Design Database using SDLC, design from database up
- Design Software using SDLC
- Take screenshots of Asana to demonstrate project management
- Use Evolutionary and incremental prototyping for consistent delivery
- Create some models
- Experiment with Docker or Kubernetes containers for microservices
- NGINX or Apache for web server

- Use Gatsby static rendering for landing page for speed, server rendering with Next.js for the main app 
- Pusher

## DONE
- Reduced scope for more realistic plan
- React frontend and Java Spring Boot backend with MySQL (PostgreSQL)
- Jenkins CI/CD
- Deploy onto AWS
- Create a frontend toolchain
- start a test suite and TDD, JUnit/Jest?
- Use Spring Boot backend
- MVC architecture with React as V, 
- Hibernate, ORM, Junit and Mockito
