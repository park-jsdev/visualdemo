# Project Plan
- System Design Overview
- Implement Learning from Database, Software Engineering and Software Architecture & Design Courses
- Create the frontend prototype landing page
- Design Database using SDLC, design from database up
- Design Software using SDLC
- Take screenshots of Asana to demonstrate project management
- Use Evolutionary and incremental prototyping for consistent delivery

## TODO
- Setup Project Plan
- High Level Design
- Create some models
- Figure out what technologies to use
https://medium.com/@mukundmadhav/build-and-deploy-react-app-with-spring-boot-and-mysql-6f888eb0c600 to learn React frontend and Java Spring Boot backend with MySQL
- Jenkins CI/CD
- Docker for management
- NGNIX or Apache for web server
- Deploy onto AWS or GCloud, install Kubernetes

- Create a frontend toolchain
- start a test suite and TDD, JUnit/Jest?
https://frontarm.com/james-k-nelson/static-vs-server-rendering/ 
- Use Gatsby static rendering for landing page for speed, server rendering with Next.js for the main app 

- JEE stack:
- MVC architecture with React as V, 
- Figure out Spring MVC or Spring Boot for backend, Boot is easier, Hibernate is a db framework
- Spring Data REST
- Spring Tool Suite
- Pusher
- Hibernate, ORM, Junit and Mockito
- Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow?
- Microservice framework development with spring boot
